## Installation

Follow these steps to set up the project locally:

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/yourproject.git
   cd yourproject
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**:

   - Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add your environment variables.

## Usage

To start the application, run the following command:

```bash
npm start
```

This will start the development server, and you can access the application at `http://localhost:3000`.

## Database Setup

### RxDB Configuration

1. **Database Initialization**: The database is initialized in the `src/database/db.js` file. Ensure that the schemas are defined correctly with primary keys.

2. **Creating the Database**: The `createDatabase` function checks for an existing database instance and creates one if it doesn't exist. Make sure to clear any existing databases in your browser's IndexedDB if you encounter issues.

3. **Schema Definitions**: Ensure that your schemas (e.g., `businessSchema`, `articleSchema`) are defined with the required properties, including primary keys.

### Example Schema

```javascript
const businessSchema = {
  title: "business schema",
  version: 0,
  type: "object",
  properties: {
    id: {
      type: "string",
      primary: true,
    },
    name: {
      type: "string",
    },
  },
};
```
